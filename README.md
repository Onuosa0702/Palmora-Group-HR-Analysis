## 📌 Project Overview

Amid public backlash and reputational risk, Palmoria’s CHRO initiated an internal audit to evaluate diversity, equity, and fairness across departments and regions. As the lead HR data analyst, I was tasked with cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the company’s employee dataset to:

- Examine gender representation
- Identify salary disparities
- Assess compliance with regulatory pay standards
- Recommend equitable bonus distribution strategies
